\chapter{Specification}
uhms, I don't think this section will have interesting diagrams.
should it contain the theory? DSL, XML (vocabulary, grammar, motivations), intercommunication with other systems (config files, structure.xml...)

relate to reengineering (R Pressmann): abstraction, procedures, etc.

Users: no users (well, a "virtual" user does exist). it's a meta-app that reads apps in xml and renders them in html. define input and output.

contracts: no contracts. TDD as opposed to design by contract??? check literature

Use Cases: one per directive, settings and entities?? users: the system.
