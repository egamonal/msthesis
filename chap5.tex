\chapter{Specification}
uhms, I don't think this section will have interesting diagrams.
should it contain the theory? DSL, XML (vocabulary, grammar, motivations), intercommunication with other systems (config files, structure.xml...)

relate to reengineering (R Pressmann): abstraction, procedures, etc.

Users: no users (well, a "virtual" user does exist). it's a meta-app that reads apps in xml and renders them in html. define input and output.

contracts: no contracts. TDD as opposed to design by contract??? check literature

Use Cases: one per directive, settings and entities?? users: the system.


Larman: system sequence diagram + contracts of system operations
meyer: design by contract

Design by Contract and Test Driven Development are not at all mutually exclusive.
TDD is not about testing!! is about executable specs
"The first idea is about test-driven development not being a testing technique;
automatic tests only become ”tests” after having implemented all the functionality
being test-
driven
. Before that there is nothing to actually
test
and those artifacts
rather serve as executable
specifications
but not tests"

up to date documentation: a common problem is that docs are hardly ever updated
