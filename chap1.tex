\chapter{Introduction}

Outlying the contents of a thesis before writing them is way of self-organising and writing it nicely.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compare $e_1$ and $e_2$.
  \item Shift the mantissa associated with the smaller exponent $|e_1-e_2|$
        places to the right.
  \item Add $m_1$ and $m_2$.
  \item Find the first one in the resulting mantissa.
  \item Shift the resulting mantissa so that normalized
  \item Adjust the exponent accordingly.
\end{enumerate}
