This project aims to reengineer a content manager for humanoid robots with web technology at \company in order to abandon the current \flash implementation.
It lives in the robot, displays contents applications and handles user interaction.

In the first part, this thesis describes the boundaries and context of the project and provides a general overview of related topics that support this work.

In the second part, it addresses formally the reengineering of the software based on Pressman's work, in 6 steps: software inventory, documentation restructure and reverse engineering, code and data restructuring and forward engineering.

First it identifies the constraints of the project along with functional and non-functional requirements.

Secondly, it presents the specification emphasising the first 3 steps.
It includes a conceptual model, system use cases and sequence diagrams.

Next, it describes the internal design of the system in the context of the last 3 steps.
It starts by highlighting the architecture of the system, the context and the software patterns.
After this, it provides a static view with class and packages diagram, and a dynamic view with sequence diagrams.
The chapter closes with a physical view.

The following chapter provides an overview of the most relevant parts of the implementation and illustrates it with code examples.

Finally, it outlines the testing strategy and explains the implementation of the testing system.

In conclusion, this master's thesis addresses the development of the new system with precision and consistency and describes the construction of the software applying a systematic approach, proven techniques like software patterns and architectures and creativity.
