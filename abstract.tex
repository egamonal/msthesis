This project aims at reengineering a content manager for humanoid robots with web technology at \company in order to abandon the current \flash implementation.
This software in the robot displays content applications and handles user interaction.

In the first part, this thesis describes the boundaries and context of the project and provides a general overview of related topics that support this work.

In the second part, this thesis addresses the reengineering of the software based on Pressman's work, in 6 steps: software inventory, documentation restructure and reverse engineering, code and data restructuring and forward engineering.

First it identifies the constraints of the project as well as its functional and non-functional requirements.

Secondly, it presents the specification emphasising the first 3 steps.
This work includes a conceptual model, system use cases and sequence diagrams.

Thirdly, it describes the internal design of the system in the context of the last 3 steps.
It starts by highlighting the system's architecture, its context and the software patterns.
Fourthly, it provides a static view with class and packages diagram, a dynamic view with sequence diagrams and a physical view with a deployment diagram.

The following chapter provides an overview of the most relevant parts of the implementation with code examples.

Finally, it outlines the testing strategy and explains the testing system's implementation.

In conclusion, this master's thesis addresses the development of the new system with accuracy and consistency and describes the construction of the software applying a systematic approach, proven techniques like software patterns and architectures, and creativity.
