The goal of this thesis is to implement a software to display the application
contents of the robots Reem H2 and H3 (PAL Robotics). The software reads XML 
files created with the screens editor of the company and transforms them to HTML5.

The development of this project took place between April and September of 
2013 in the office of PAL Robotics. Special interest was put in the integration
and backwards compatibility of the system, bla bla bla

The result of this thesis is a fully functional software that meets the 
requirements bla bla bla
