    \item Robustness: the software has to be reliable and has to be delivered with comprehensive test suites. It should be compatible with Jenkins and continous integration.
    \item Technology: the project has to be implemented using modern web technologies (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS).
    \item Hardware: the software has to perform smoothly in Reem H2 and a multitouch screen.
    \item UX: the time to change to another screen in the rendered contents application should be less than 0.5s. Media contents (images, videos) have to be ready in less than 1s after a screen change.
